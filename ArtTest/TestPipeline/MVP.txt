Dark, Lonely, Solo Character, Minimal Environment

The idea of being stranded in an unknown, inescapable environment is one of the many
fears people have. For me, to be stranded in the dark, desolate ocean with no one around
and not know what's lurking around the waters. With only a small ground to hold you above
above sea level, not knowing whether you'll be rescued or to meet your impending doom.
